* If you are using different version of Visual Studio i.e. Professional or Enterprise other than Community, then replace the Community folder in the path by your respective version name.
* Also if you are using any other Year's version of Visual Studio other than 2017, then replace 2017 with your version's year
* And finally depending upon your version of ROS, you can replace Melodic with Noetic
